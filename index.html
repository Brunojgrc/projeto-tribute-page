            <h3>The Musician</h3>
            <p>George Harrison (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and
                music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes
                called "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular
                music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles'
                work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most
                Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group
                include "Taxman", "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and
                "Something".<br><br>

                Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet
                Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk
                rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use
                of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". Having initiated the band's embracing of
                Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna
                movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a
                critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "My Sweet Lord", and introduced
                his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for
                Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In
                his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label
                before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978.<br><br>

                Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded
                the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as
                a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and
                music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked
                him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time Rock and Roll
                Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in
                2004.<br><br>

                Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he
                married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age
                of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were
                cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges
                and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.</p>
